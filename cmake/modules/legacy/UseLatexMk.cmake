# UseLatexMk.cmake is a CMake module to build Latex documents
# from CMake.
#
# add_latex_document(SOURCE texsource
#                    [TARGET target]
#                    [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]
#                    [REQUIRED]
#                    [FATHER_TARGET father1 [father2 ...]]
#                    [RCFILE rcfile1 [rcfile2 ...]]
#                    [INSTALL destination]
#                    [BUILD_ON_INSTALL]
#                    )
#
# The arguments:
# SOURCE
#   Required argument with a single tex source that defines the document to be built
# TARGET
#   An optional target name, defaults to a suitable mangling of the given source and its path.
#   An additional target with _clean appended will be added as well, which cleans the output
#   and all auxiliary files.
# EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL
#   Set this to avoid the target from being built by default. If the FATHER_TARGET
#   parameter is set, this option is automatically set.
# REQUIRED
#   Set this option to issue a fatal error if the document could not
#   be built. By default it is only skipped.
# FATHER_TARGET
#   A list of meta-targets that should trigger a rebuild of this target (like "make doc").
#   The targets are expected to exist already. Specifying any such targets will automatically add the
#   above EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL option.
# RCFILE
#   A list configuration file to customize the latexmk build process. These are read by latexmk
#   *after* the automatically generated rc file in the indicated order. Note that latexmk rcfiles
#   override any previous settings.
#   You may also use CMake variables within @'s (like @CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR@) and have
#   them replaced with the matching CMake variables (see cmake's configure_file command).
#   Note, that this is a powerful, but advanced feature. For details on what can be achieved
#   see the latexmk manual. Note, that triggering non-PDF builds through latexmkrc files might
#   cause problems with other features of UseLatexMk.
# INSTALL
#   Set this option to an install directory to create an installation rule for this document.
# BUILD_ON_INSTALL
#   Set this option, if you want to trigger a build of this document during installation.
#
# Furthermore, UseLatexMk defines a CMake target clean_latex which cleans the build tree from
# all PDF output and all auxiliary files. Note, that (at least for the Unix Makefiles generator)
# it is not possible to connect this process with the builtin clean target.
#
# Please note the following security restriction:
#
# UseLatexMk relies on latexmk separating input and output directory correctly.
# This includes using an absolute path for the output directory. On some TeX
# systems this requires the disabling of a security measure by setting `openout_any = a`.
# From the latexmk documentation:
#
# Commonly, the directory specified for output files is a subdirectory of the current working direc-
# tory. However, if you specify some other directory, e.g., "/tmp/foo" or "../output", be aware that
# this could cause problems, e.g., with makeindex or bibtex. This is because modern versions of
# these programs, by default, will refuse to work when they find that they are asked to write to a file
# in a directory that appears not to be the current working directory or one of its subdirectories. This
# is part of security measures by the whole TeX system that try to prevent malicious or errant TeX
# documents from incorrectly messing with a user’s files. If for $out_dir or $aux_dir you really do
# need to specify an absolute pathname (e.g., "/tmp/foo") or a path (e.g., "../output") that includes a
# higher-level directory, and you need to use makeindex or bibtex, then you need to disable the secu-
# rity measures (and assume any risks). One way of doing this is to temporarily set an operating
# system environment variable openout_any to "a" (as in "all"), to override the default "paranoid"
# setting.
#
# UseLatexMk.cmake allows to reenable the TeX security measure by setting LATEXMK_PARANOID to TRUE
# through cmake -D, but it is not guaranteed to work correctly in that case.
