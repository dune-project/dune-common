# Implementation of a simplified CMake build system.
#
# .. cmake_function:: dune_enable_all_packages
#
#    .. cmake_brief::
#
#       Previously, the DUNE build system relied on the user to choose and add the compile and link flags
#       necessary to build an executable. While this offers full control to the user, it
#       is an error-prone procedure.
#
#       Alternatively, users may use this function to simply add the compile flags for all
#       found external modules to all executables in a DUNE module. Likewise, all found libraries are
#       linked to all targets.
#
#    .. cmake_param:: INCLUDE_DIRS
#       :multi:
#
#       A list of include directories, that should be added to all targets.
#       In a standard Dune module, it is not necessary to specify anything.
#
#    .. cmake_param:: COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
#       :multi:
#
#       A list of compile definitions, that should be added to all targets.
#       In a standard Dune module, it is not necessary to specify anything.
#
#    .. cmake_param:: COMPILE_OPTIONS
#       :multi:
#
#       A list of non-definition compile options, that should be added to all targets.
#       In a standard Dune module, it is not necessary to specify anything.
#
#    .. cmake_param:: MODULE_LIBRARIES
#       :multi:
#
#       If your module contains libraries as well as programs and if the programs should automatically
#       link to those libraries, you *MUST* list these libraries in :code:`MODULE_LIBRARIES`. Those libraries will be
#       automatically created by :ref:`dune_enable_all_packages` (which internally calls :ref:`dune_add_library`) and placed
#       in the lib/ directory. The order of the libraries matters: if one library depends on another one, it must
#       be listed after its dependency. This special handling of the libraries is due to the way newer CMake
#       versions handle linking (in particular CMP022 and CMP038). You can later add source files to the library
#       anywhere in the source tree by calling :ref:`dune_library_add_sources`.
#
#       .. warning::
#          The library feature requires CMake 3.1+. If you use the feature with older versions, CMake
#          will emit a fatal error. Moreover, it will issue a warning if the :code:`cmake_minimum_required`
#          version is older than 3.1.
#
#    .. cmake_param:: VERBOSE
#       :option:
#
#       If this option is set, the set of compile flags, linked libraries and include directories
#       that is in use for all targets in the module is printed upon configuration.
#
#    .. cmake_param:: APPEND
#       :option:
#
#       If this option is set, the definitions, flags and directories specified in this function are
#       appended to the global collection of flags instead of being prepended. Only use it, if you know
#       what you are doing.
#
#    Adds all flags and all libraries to all executables that are subsequently added in the directory
#    from where this function is called and from all its subdirectories (recursively).
#    If used, this function *MUST* be called in the top level CMakeLists.txt BEFORE adding any subdirectories!
#    You can optionally add additional include dirs and compile definitions that will also be applied to
#    all targets in the module.
#
#    .. note::
#       If you want to use :code:`dune_enable_all_packages` with an older version of CMake and your DUNE module
#       creates its own library, you have to manually create the library in the top-level CMakeLists.txt
#       file using :ref:`dune_add_library` (with all sources listed within that call), use
#       :ref:`dune_target_enable_all_packages` to add all packages to the library and finally list that library
#       under :code:`LIBRARIES` in the call to :ref:`dune_register_package_flags`. See dune-pdelab for an example of
#       how to do this correctly.
#
#    While :ref:`dune_enable_all_packages` defines the user interface for this feature, developers might
#    also be interested in the following related functions:
#
#    * :ref:`dune_target_enable_all_packages`
#    * :ref:`dune_register_package_flags`
#    * :ref:`dune_library_add_sources`
#
# .. cmake_function:: dune_target_enable_all_packages
#
#    .. cmake_param:: TARGETS
#       :multi:
#
#       A list of targets to add all flags etc. too.
#
#    Adds all currently registered package flags (see :ref:`dune_register_package_flags`) to the given targets.
#    This function is mainly intended to help write DUNE modules that want to use :ref:`dune_enable_all_packages` and
#    define their own libraries, but need to be compatible with CMake < 3.1
#
# .. cmake_function:: dune_register_package_flags
#
#    .. cmake_param:: INCLUDE_DIRS
#       :multi:
#
#       The list of include directories needed by the external package.
#
#    .. cmake_param:: COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
#       :multi:
#
#       The list of compile definitions needed by the external package.
#
#    .. cmake_param:: COMPILE_OPTIONS
#       :multi:
#
#       The list of compile options needed by the external package.
#
#    .. cmake_param:: LIBRARIES
#       :multi:
#
#       The list of libraries that the external package should link to.
#       The order of the input is preserved in the output.
#
#    .. cmake_param:: APPEND
#       :option:
#
#       If this option is set, the definitions, flags and directories specified in this function are
#       appended to the global collection of flags instead of being prepended. Only use it, if you know
#       what you are doing.
#
#    To correctly implement the automatic handling of external libraries, the compile flags, include paths and link
#    flags of all found packages must be registered with this function. This function is only necessary for people that
#    want to write their own :code:`FindFooBar` CMake modules to link against additional libraries which are not supported by
#    the DUNE core modules. Call this function at the end of every find module. If you are using an external FindFoo
#    module which you cannot alter, call it after the call to :code:`find_package(foo)`.
#
# .. cmake_function:: dune_library_add_sources
#
#    .. cmake_param:: module_library
#       :single:
#       :positional:
#
#       The name of the module library target.
#
#    .. cmake_param: SOURCES
#       :multi:
#       :required:
#
#       The source files to add to the DUNE module library :code:`module_library`.
#       That library must have been created by an earlier call to :ref:`dune_enable_all_packages`
#       in the current DUNE module.
#
#    Register sources for module exported library.
