FindPTScotch
------------

Find library PTScotch, i.e. Software package and libraries for sequential
and parallel graph partitioning, static mapping and clustering, sequential
mesh and hypergraph partitioning, and sequential and parallel sparse matrix
block ordering

Components
^^^^^^^^^^

The PTScotch module allows to search for the following components

``SCOTCH``
  Sequential version of Scotch
``PTSCOTCH``
  Parallel version of Scotch. Requires MPI.

Imported targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines the following :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` target:

``PTScotch::Scotch``
  The sequential Scotch library to link against
``PTScotch::PTScotch``
  The parallel PTScotch library to link against

Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines the following variables:

``PTScotch_FOUND``
  The Scotch and/or PTScotch library with all its dependencies is found
``PTScotch_SCOTCH_FOUND``
  The sequential Scotch library is found
``PTScotch_PTSCOTCH_FOUND``
  The parallel PTScotch library is found
``PTScotch_VERSION``
  Version of Scotch that is found

Cache Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following variables may be set to influence this module's behavior:

``PTSCOTCH_SUFFIX``
  Scotch might be compiled using different integer sizes (int32, int64, long).
  When this is set the headers and libaries are search under the suffix
  :code:`include/scotch-${PTSCOTCH_SUFFIX}`, and :code:`lib/scotch-${PTSCOTCH_SUFFIX}`,
  respectively.

``SCOTCH_INCLUDE_DIR``
  Include directory where the scotch.h is found.

``PTSCOTCH_INCLUDE_DIR``
  Include directory where the ptscotch.h is found.

``SCOTCH_LIBRARY`` and ``SCOTCHERR_LIBRARY``
  Full path to the scotch library

``PTSCOTCH_LIBRARY`` and ``PTSCOTCHERR_LIBRARY``
  Full path to the ptscotch library
