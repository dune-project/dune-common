# .. cmake_module::
#
#    Module that checks whether PT-Scotch is available.
#
#    You may set the following variables to customize this modules behaviour:
#
#    :ref:`PTSCOTCH_ROOT`
#       Prefix where PT-Scotch is installed.
#
#    :ref:`PTSCOTCH_SUFFIX`
#       Scotch might be compiled using different
#       integer sizes (int32, int64, long). When
#       this is is set the headers and libaries
#       are search under the suffix
#       :code:`include/scotch-${PTSCOTCH_SUFFIX}`, and
#       :code:`lib/scotch-${PTSCOTCH_SUFFIX}`, respectively.
#
#    This module sets the following variables:
#
#    :code:`PTSCOTCH_FOUND`
#       True if PT-Scotch was found.
#
#    :code:`PTSCOTCH_INCLUDE_DIRS`
#       All include directories needed to compile PT-Scotch programs.
#
#    :code:`PTSCOTCH_LIBRARIES`
#       All libraries needed to link PT-Scotch programs.
#
#    :code:`PTSCOTCH_FOUND`
#       True if PT-Scotch was found.
#
# .. cmake_variable:: PTSCOTCH_ROOT
#
#   You may set this variable to have :ref:`FindPTScotch` look
#   for the PTScotch package in the given path before inspecting
#   system paths.
#
# .. cmake_variable:: PTSCOTCH_SUFFIX
#
#   PTScotch might be compiled using different
#   integer sizes (int32, int64, long). When
#   this is is set the headers and libaries
#   are search under the suffix
#   :code:`include/scotch-${PTSCOTCH_SUFFIX}`, and
#   :code:`lib/scotch-${PTSCOTCH_SUFFIX}`, respectively.
