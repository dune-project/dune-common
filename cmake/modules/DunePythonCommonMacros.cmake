# The python extension of the Dune cmake build system
#
# .. cmake_module::
#
#    This module is the main entry point for the python extension of the Dune cmake
#    build system. It handles the detection of the python installation, defines installation
#    rules for python packages in Dune modules and provides virtual environments to
#    run python code from cmake.
#
#    If you want to use Dune modules that provide Python functionality, you should be aware
#    of some facts:
#
#    * CMake looks for your python interpreter during configure. If you want to have it
#      work with a virtual environment, you should activate your virtualenv before configure.
#    * Each module has an additional target :code:`make install_python`, that installs python packages
#      defined in the Dune module. You can customize the install location with
#      :ref:`DUNE_PYTHON_INSTALL_LOCATION`. This is also included in :code:`make install`.
#    * There is additional functionality, that automatically sets up a virtual environment
#      at configure time, you can read more at :ref:`DunePythonVirtualenv`.
#
#    After the module :code:`DunePythonCommonMacros` is run (which happens automatically when
#    configuring dune-common) the following python-related variables will be set and available
#    for use in downstream modules:
#
#    * All variables set by :code:`FindPythonInterp.cmake` and :code:`FindPythonLibs.cmake`
#    * :code:`DUNE_PYTHON_SYSTEM_IS_VIRTUALENV`: True if the given system interpreter resides in
#      virtual environment.
#
#    For documentation on how to customize the build process, check the input variable
#    reference for any variables prefixed with :code:`DUNE_PYTHON`. To learn how to write build
#    system code for Dune modules shipping python, have a look at the command reference for
#    commands prefixed :code:`dune_python`.
#
# .. cmake_variable:: DUNE_PYTHON_INSTALL_LOCATION
#
#    This variable can be used to control where Dune should install python
#    packages. Possible values are:
#
#    * :code:`user`: installs into the users home directory through :code:`pip --user`. Note, that
#      this is incompatible with using virtual environments (as per pip docs).
#    * :code:`system`: into the standard paths of the interpreter which was found
#      by cmake.
#    * :code:`none`: Never install any python packages.
#
#    The default value in use depends on the system interpreter to run in a virtual environment
#    or not: If it does, :code:`system` is the default, if it does not :code:`none` is the default.
#    This rather unintuitive default originates from the strong belief, that installing
#    python packages into the system locations at :code:`/usr/...` should be discouraged.
#
# .. cmake_variable:: DUNE_PYTHON_VIRTUALENV_SETUP
#
#    Set this variable to allow the Dune build system to set up a virtualenv at
#    configure time. Such virtual environment is very useful, whenever python code
#    is to be run at configure time, i.e. to implement code generation in Python or
#    to use Python wrappers in testing. Some downstream modules will *require* you
#    to set this variable. When setting this variable, you allow the Dune buildsystem
#    to install packages through :code:`pip` into a virtualenv, that resides in a cmake
#    build directory. For all the information on this virtualenv, see :ref:`DunePythonVirtualenv`.
#
# .. cmake_function:: dune_python_require_virtualenv_setup
#
#    Call this function from a downstream module, if that module relies on the
#    the presence of the configure time virtualenv described in :ref:`DunePythonVirtualenv`.
