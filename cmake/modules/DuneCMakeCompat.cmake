# Module with backward compatibility implementation of newer cmake functionality

# .. cmake_module::
#
#    This module contains backward compatibility implementations of cmake
#    functionality that is not available in all cmake versions we support.
#
#    * :ref:`dune_list_filter(...) <dune_list_filter>` for ``list(FILTER
#      ...)`` from cmake 3.7
#
#
# .. cmake_function:: dune_list_filter
#
#    .. cmake_brief::
#
#       Compatibility implementation of ``list(FILTER)``
#
#    .. cmake_param:: list
#       :positional:
#       :single:
#       :required:
#
#       Name of list variable used as both input and output.
#
#    .. cmake_param:: <INCLUDE|EXCLUDE>
#       :positional:
#       :option:
#       :required:
#
#       Whether to include or to exclude the items matching the regular
#       expression.
#
#    .. cmake_param:: REGEX
#       :single:
#       :required:
#       :argname: regular_expression
#
#       The regular expression to match the items against.
#
#    Match each item in the list against the regular expression.  In
#    ``INCLUDE`` mode the result contains all items that matched, in
#    ``EXCLUDE`` mode it contains all items that did not match.  Store the
#    result back in the variable ``list`` in the scope of the caller.
#
#    This is exactly the same as the ``list(FILTER ...)`` command available in
#    cmake 3.7 and onward.


# list(FILTER...) was introduced in cmake 3.6, this is a compatibility
# implementation for earlier cmakes
