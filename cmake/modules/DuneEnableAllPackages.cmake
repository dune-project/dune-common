# This module provides the macros necessary for a simplified CMake build system
#
# The dune build system relies on the user to choose and add the compile and link flags
# necessary to build an executable. While this offers full control to the user, it
# is an error-prone procedure.
#
# Alternatively, users may use this modules macros to simply add the compile flags for all
# found external modules to all executables in a module. Likewise, all found libraries are
# linked to all targets.
#
# This module provides the following macros:
#
# dune_enable_all_packages(INCLUDE_DIRS [include_dirs]
#                          COMPILE_DEFINITIONS [compile_definitions]
#                          MODULE_LIBRARIES [libraries]
#                          [VERBOSE] [APPEND]
#                          )
#
# Adds all flags and all libraries to all executables that are subsequently added in the directory
# from where this macro is called and from all its subdirectories (recursively).
# If used, this macro MUST be called in the top level CMakeLists.txt BEFORE adding any subdirectories!
# You can optionally add additional include dirs and compile definitions that will also be applied to
# all targets in the module.
# Finally, if your module contains libraries as well as programs and if the programs should automatically
# link to those libraries, you MUST list these libraries in MODULE_LIBRARIES. Those libraries will be
# automatically created by dune_enable_all_packages (which internally calls dune_add_library()) and placed
# in the lib/ directory. The order of the libraries matters: if one library depends on another one, it must
# be listed after its dependency. This special handling of the libraries is due to the way newer CMake
# versions handle linking (in particular CMP022 and CMP038). You can later add source files to the library
# anywhere in the source tree by calling dune_library_add_sources().
#
# Warning: The library feature requires CMake 3.1+. If you use the feature with older versions, CMake
#          will emit a fatal error. Moreover, it will issue a warning if the cmake_minimum_required()
#          version is older than 3.1.
#
# For a description of the APPEND option, see the documentation of dune_register_package_flags().
# With the VERBOSE option being set, the list of flags is printed during configure.
#
# dune_register_package_flags(COMPILE_DEFINITIONS flags
#                             INCLUDE_DIRS includes
#                             LIBRARIES libs
#                            [APPEND]
#                            )
#
# To implement above feature, the compile flags, include paths and link flags of all
# found packages must be registered with this macro. This macro is only necessary for people
# that do link against additional libraries which are not supported by the dune core modules.
# Call this at the end of every find module. If you are using an external find module which
# you cannot alter, call it after the call find_package().
# The APPEND parameter appends the given flags to the global list instead of prepending.
# Only use it, if you know what you are doing.
