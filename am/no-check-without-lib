# many tests need parts of libdune. Telling the tests to use
# previously build partial libs is possible but difficult to maintain:
# the SUBDIRS have to be very carefully defined for this to work...
# Additionally, testing with a partial lib is unrealistic.
#
# As users may try to use "make check" without a full build we
# generate a meaningful error message instead of silently failing on a
# lib-dependency

# add a new dependency to automake-internal rule
