  //! Utility class for handling nested indentation in output.
  /**
   * An indentation object hast a string basic_indent and an indentation
   * level.  When it is put into a std::ostream using << it will print its
   * basic_indent as many times as its indentation level.  By default the
   * basic_indent will be two spaces and the indentation level will be 0.
   *
   * An Indent object may also have a reference to a parent Indent object.  If
   * it has, that object it put into the stream with the << operator before
   * the indentation of this object is put into the stream.  This effectively
   * chains Indent objects together.
   *
   * You can use the ++ operator to raise and the -- operator to lower the
   * indentation by one level.
   *
   * You can use the + operator with a numeric second argument morelevel to
   * create a copy of the Indent object with the indentation level increased
   * morelevel times.  This is mainly useful to pass indent+1 to a function,
   * where indent is an indentation object.
   *
   * You can use the + operator with a string second argument newindent to
   * create a new Indent object with this object as parent, a basic_indent of
   * newindent, and an indentation level of one.  This is mainly useful to
   * pass indent+"> " to a function, where "> " is a possibly different
   * indentation string then the one used by indent indentation object.
   *
   * \note The idea is for functions receive indentation objects as call by
   *       value parameters.  This way, the indentation object of the caller
   *       will not be modified by the function and the function can simply
   *       return at anytime without having to clean up.
