     * @section understand_simd Understanding SIMD types
     *
     * The (idealized) model of a SIMD type `V` used in this abstraction layer
     * is that they are fixed-length vectors of some scalar type `S`.
     * Operations and operators that take values of type `S` as arguments,
     * except for `operator,()`, should be overloaded to support values of
     * type `V` too.  These operations should apply element-wise.  If the
     * operation takes more than one argument, it should accept arbitrary
     * combinations of `V` and `S`.  The exception is the combination of `S`
     * on the left hand side and `V` on the right hand side of one of the
     * assignment operators, which does not make sense.
     *
     * The result of a boolean operation is a mask type `M`, which is a SIMD
     * type with scalar type `bool` with the same number of elements as `V`.
     * The result of all other operations is again of type `V`, or of some
     * type convertible to `V`.
     *
     * This is very similiar to `std::valarray`, with the main difference
     * being that `std::valarray` is dynamic in size, while for this
     * abstraction the size is static.
     *
     * @section SIMDLibPromoWarn Type promotion issues
     *
     * True SIMD types have an issue with type promotion, which means they
     * cannot behave completely analogous to built-in integral types (this is
     * a non-issue with floating point types).  Essentially, operations on
     * true SIMD types cannot promote their arguments, because the promoted
     * types typically require more storage than the original types, meaning
     * an argument that was passed in a single vector register would need
     * multiple vector registers after promotion, which would mean greater
     * register pressure.  Also, there would be conversion operations
     * required, which (at least on x86) is not typically the case for
     * promotions of the built-in types.  Lastly, with larger types the vector
     * units can typically operate on fewer lanes at a time.
     *
     * Omitting integral promotions has in many cases no negative impact,
     * because many programmers do not really expect them anyway.  There are
     * however cases where they matter, and for illustration I want to explain
     * one that crept up during unit testing.
     *
     * Here is a simplified (and somewhat pseudo-code) version of the test.
     * The test checks the result of unary `-` on `Vc::Vector<unsigned short>`
     * by comparing the result of unary `-` when applied to the complete
     * vector to the result of unary `-` when applied to each lane
     * individually.
     * \code
     * Vc::Vector<unsigned short> varg;
     * for(std::size_t l = 0; l < lanes(varg); ++l)
     *   lane(l, varg) = l + 1;
     * auto vresult = -varg;
     * for(std::size_t l = 0; l < lanes(varg); ++l)
     *   assert(lane(l, vresult) == -lane(l, varg));
     * \endcode
     * The test fails in lane 0.  On the left side of the `==`, `lane(0,
     * vresult)` is `(unsigned short)65535`, which is the same as `(unsigned
     * short)-1`, as it should be.  On the right side, `lane(0, varg)` is
     * `(unsigned short)1`.  `-` promotes its argument, so that becomes
     * `(int)1`, and the result of the negation is `(int)-1`.
     *
     * Now the comparison is `(unsigned short)65535 == (int)-1`.  The
     * comparison operator applies the *usual arithmetic conversions* to bring
     * both operands to the same type.  In this case this boils down to
     * converting the left side to `int` via integral promotions and the
     * comparison becomes `(int)65535 == (int)-1`.  The result is of course
     * `false` and the assertion triggers.
     *
     * The only way to thoroughly prevent this kind of problem is to convert
     * the result of any operation back to the expected type.  In the above
     * example, the assertion would need to be written as `assert(lane(l,
     * vresult) == static_cast<unsigned short>(-lane(l, varg)));`.  In
     * practice, this should only be a problem with operations on unsigned
     * types where the result may be "negative".  Most code in Dune will want
     * to operate on floating point types, where this is a non-issue.
     *
     * (Of couse, this is also a problem for code that operates on untrusted
     * input, but you shoul not be doing that with Dune anyway).
     *
     * Still, when writing code using the SIMD abstractions, you should be
     * aware that in the following snippet
     * \code
     * auto var1 = lane(0, -vec);
     * auto var2 = -lane(0, vec);
     * \endcode
     * the exact types of `var1` and `var2` may be somewhat surprising.
     *
     * @section simd_abstraction_limit Limitations of the Abstraction Layer
     *
     * Since the abstraction layer cannot overload operators of SIMD types
     * (that would be meddling with the domain of the library that provides
     * the SIMD types), nor provide it's own constructors, there are severe
     * limitations in what the abstraction layer guarantees.  Besides the
     * standard types, the first SIMD library supported is Vc, so that is
     * where most of the limitations stem from; see \ref SIMDVcRestrictions in
     * \ref SIMDVc.
     *
     * The biggest limitations are with masks.  In Vc masks support a very
     * restricted set of operations compared to other SIMD types, so in what
     * follows we will distinguish between masks with a very small set of
     * operations and between vectors with a larger set of operations.
     *
     * Here is a compact table of the limitations as a quick reference,
     * together with suggested workarounds for the constructs that don't work.
     * `s` denotes a scalar object/expression (i.e. of type `double` or in the
     * case of masks `bool`).  `v` denotes a vector/mask object/expression.
     * `sv` means that both scalar and vector arguments are accepted.  `V`
     * denotes a vector/mask type.  `@` means any applicable operator that is
     * not otherwise listed.
     *
     * <!-- The following table is in orgtbl format -- If you are using emacs,
     *      you may want to enable the `orgtbl` minor mode.  We substitute `|`
     *      with `¦` when describing or-operators so as to not confuse
     *      orgtbl. -->

     * Notes:
     *
     * - [1] In Vc, mask-mask `==` and `!=` operations exist, but the result
     *   is of type `bool`, i.e. a scalar.
     *
     * - [2] `++` (either kind) on bools is deprecated by the standard.  Our
     *   test suite does not check for it on masks, but it was supported by Vc
     *   masks at some point.
     *
     * - [3] Contrary to the other operators, the expected result for `(sv1,
     *   sv2)` is exactly `sv2`, no broadcasting applied.
     *
     * - [4] Try to avoid the use of `operator,` unless both operands are
     *   built-in types if possible.  Libraries had a tendency to overload
     *   `operator,` to provide for things like container initialization
     *   before C++11, and these overloads may still be present in the library
     *   you are using and replace the default meaning of `operator,`.
     *
     * Support levels:
     *
     * - `y`: operation generally works; some instances of the operation may
     *   not apply
     *
     * - `*N*`: operation generally does not work; some instances of the
     *   operation may not apply
     *
     * - `n/a`: operation does not apply (i.e. bitwise operations to
     *   floating-point operands, `--` (and in the future possibly `++`) to
     *   boolean operands, assignment operators to scalar left hand sides)
