Preparing the SVN-sources
=========================

Additional to the software mentioned in README you'll need the
following programs installed on your system:

  automake >= 1.9

  autoconf >= 2.52

  libtool

For the documentation to build you'll need doxygen, wml, convert and latex
installed.

Dune also features a self-test. As some components (e.g. Albert,
UG) depend on external libraries their self-tests will only run if
those libraries are found. The paths to their installation prefix
would then need to be passed via --with-...= parameters to configure.

Important!  If you don't want to develop Dune itself you won't need to
provide external components! The Dune-library and -headers are
independent of other libraries, instead the applications can choose
which parts to use.
