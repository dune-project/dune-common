.SH NAME
dunecontrol \- Control program for the Dune build system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dunecontrol
[\fIOPTIONS\fP] \fICOMMANDS\fP [\fICOMMAND-OPTIONS\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dunecontrol
is the control program for the build system of the Dune libraries.

The Dune libraries form a set of modules.  Each can be built independently using CMake.
Additionally, though, there are dependencies between modules,
which are expected to form a directed acyclic graph.  These dependencies are set in a
file called
.B dune.module
contained in the main directory of each Dune module.

The
.B dunecontrol
program helps to build sets of inter-dependent modules.  It allows to construct
the entire dependency graph and obtain information about it.  Then it allows to run various build-related
commands for all modules.  These are executed in the order mandated by the dependency graph.

.SH COMMANDS
Colon-separated list of commands. Available commands are:
.HP
.B help
.IP
Show a help message and exit
.HP
.B print
.IP
Print the list of modules sorted according to their dependency relations

.B info
.IP
Same as `print', but including whether it is a dependency or suggestion
.HP
.B printdeps
.IP
Print recursive dependencies of a module
.HP
.B vcsetup
.IP
Setup version control repository (Git etc.) or working copy (SVN)
.HP
.B update

.HP
.B make
.IP

.HP
.B all
.IP
Run the 'configure' and 'make' commands for each module
.HP
.B exec
.IP
Execute an arbitrary command in each module source directory
.HP
.B bexec

Show this help
.HP
\fB--debug\fP
.IP
Run with debugging output enabled
.HP
\fB--module=\fP\fImod\fP
.IP
Apply the actions on module
.I mod
and all modules it depends on
.HP
\fB--only=\fP\fImod\fP
.IP
Only apply the actions on module
.I mod
, but not on the modules it depends on
.HP
\fB--current\fP
.IP
Only apply the actions on the current module, the one whose source tree we are in
.HP
\fB--current-dep\fP
.IP
Apply the actions on the current module, and all modules it depends on

.IP
Load default options from \fIfile\fP
.HP
\fB--builddir=\fP\fIname\fP
.IP

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.B dunecontrol
looks for Dune modules in all directories given in the
.B DUNE_CONTROL_PATH
variable, and additionally recursively in all subdirectories of those directories.
The default for the case that DUNE_CONTROL_PATH is empty is the current directory,
plus a system-wide installation in /usr.
