.SH NAME
dunecontrol \- Control program for the Dune build system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dunecontrol
[\fIOPTIONS\fP] \fICOMMANDS\fP [\fICOMMAND-OPTIONS\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dunecontrol
is the control program for the build system of the Dune libraries.

The Dune libraries form a set of modules.  Each can be built independently using either
the AutoTools or cmake.  Additionally, though, there are dependencies between modules,
which are expected to form a directed acyclic graph.  These dependencies are set in a
file called
.B dune.module
contained in the main directory of a Dune module.

The
.B dunecontrol
program helps to build sets of inter-dependent modules.  It allows to construct
the entire dependency graph and obtain information about it.  Then it allows to give various build-related
commands for all modules.  These are executed in the order mandated by the dependency graph.

.SH COMMANDS
Colon-separated list of commands. Available commands are:
.HP
.B help
.IP
Shows a help message and exits
.HP
.B print
.IP
Print the list of modules sorted after their dependencies
.HP
.B info
.IP
Same as `print', but including whether it is a dependency or suggestion
.HP
.B printdeps
.IP
Print recursive dependencies of a module
.HP
.B vcsetup
.IP
Setup version control repository (Git etc.) or working copy (SVN)
.HP
.B update
.IP
Update all modules from the repository
.HP
.B autogen
.IP
Run the autogen.sh script for each module. Does nothing, if CMake is activated
.HP
.B configure
.IP
Run configure or cmake for each module
.HP
.B make
.IP
Run make for each module
.HP
.B all
.IP
Run the 'autogen', 'configure' and 'make' commands for each module
.HP
.B exec
.IP
Execute an arbitrary command in each module source directory
.HP
.B bexec
.IP
Execute an arbitrary command in each module build directory
.HP
.B status
.IP
Show version control status for all modules
.HP
.B svn
.IP
Run svn command for each svn managed module
.HP
.B git
.IP
Run git command for each git managed module
.HP
.B export
.IP
Run eval `dunecontrol export` to save the list of dune.module files to the DUNE_CONTROL_PATH variable
.SH OPTIONS
.HP
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
.IP
Show this help
.HP
\fB--debug\fP
.IP
Run with debuggin output enabled
.HP
\fB--use-cmake\fP
.IP
Use cmake instead of the AutoTools for building individual modules
.HP
\fB--module=\fP\fImod\fP
.IP
Only apply the actions on module
.I mod
and all modules it depends on
.HP
\fB--only=\fP\fImod\fP
.IP
Only apply the actions on module
.I mod
, but not the modules it depends on
.HP
\fB--current\fP
.IP
Only apply the actions on the current module, the one whose source tree we are in
.HP
\fB--resume\fP
.IP
Resume a previous run (only consider the modules not built successfully on the previous run)
.HP
\fB--skipfirst\fP
.IP
Skip the first module (use with --resume)
.HP
\fB--opts=\fP\fIfile\fP
.IP
Load default options from \fIfile\fP (see dune-common/doc/example.opts)
.HP
\fB--builddir=\fP\fIname\fP
.IP
Make out-of-source builds in a subdir \fIname\fP. This directory is created inside each module.
.HP
\fB--[COMMAND]-opts=\fP\fIopts\fP
.IP
Set options for COMMAND (this is mainly useful for the 'all' COMMAND)


.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.B dunecontrol
looks for Dune modules in all directories given in the
.B DUNE_CONTROL_PATH
variable, and additionally recursively in all subdirectories of those directories.
The default for the case that DUNE_CONTROL_PATH is empty is the current directory,
plus a system-wide installation in /usr.
